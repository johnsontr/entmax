# 06.07.2019: The following set of comments need to be updated at some point and do not
# reflect the current functionality of the tests.
#
# Some responsibility must be put on the user to properly format data.
#
# For now, let's assume that the input for response_matrix MUST be a non-empty data frame.
#
# Also assume that data is binary with the potential for a (but not a required) missing data code.
#   Consequently, don't error out if there is only one entry type, but do throw a warning to the user
#   that this might be weird.
#   If the types of entries are > 3, report counts of frequencies by entry type. Give the option to the
#   user to print all observation indices matching a specific entry. Allow the user to keep doing this
#   until the user chooses an exit option for the presented counts. This will potentially help the user
#   identify stray codes in a large data set that they can fix themselves.

# Unit tests for response_matrix will require input to be:
#   (1) a data frame,
#   (2) a non-empty data frame,
#   (3) a dataframe containing entries with at most 3 different types of codes,
#   IF yea_codes, nay_codes, AND missing_codes ARE *NOT* SPECIFIED BY THE USER:
#       (4) entries must be from {1,0,NA}
#   ELSE:
#       (5) yea_codes != nay_codes != missing_codes
#       (6) entries must be from {yea_codes, nay_codes, missing_codes}
